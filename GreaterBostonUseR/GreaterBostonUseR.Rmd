## 300 lessons later | What I've learned about R ... from teaching R

Robert Heinlein said 

"When one teaches, two learn" 


and I'm proof!

I've taught about 300 session on the R language 

for LinkedIn Learning 

(formerly Lynda.com)

## How are we alike? 
How are we different?

## Your Journey With R {.build}

A mandate to learn and use

You grumbled, but complied

A Branch:

- Those who didn't need it anymore (not here today)
- Those who did (This is you!)

You learned as much R as necessary

You also have domain and statistical expertise

## My Journey with R {.build}

An interest in programming languages

(That's it!)

No domain or statistical expertise

I've gone **really** deep on the language

## Our Priorities Differ {.build}
<div class="columns-2">

**You**

Interpret data

.

**Me**

Mess around with code

...and share it with you

</div>

## For Example...

![](lil_rweek.png)

## For Example: Matrix Math Review
<div class="columns-2">

```{r, echo=TRUE}

A + B

A - B

A * B # simple multiplication

A %*% B # Dot Product 

```
</div>

## Lesson: R is deep

There is a lot of R you may not know exists

There is a lot of R you will never use

There is a bit of R that will change your world and make you a rock star

## Example: Three Graphics Environments
**1. base R**

plot, barplot, boxplot, cdplot, coplot, dotchart, fourfoldplot, 
heatmap, hist, matlines,matplot, mosaicplot, pie, spineplot, 
stemplot, stripchart, sunflowerplot

**2. ggplot**

an external package for grammar of graphics. VERY popular

**3. lattice**

+ included with R. Faster than ggplot, 
+ better awareness of output device. 
+ barchart, bwplot, densityplot, dotplot, histogram, qqmath, stripplot, qq, xyplot, levelplot, contourplot, cloud, wireframe, splom, parallel, rfs, tmd

## Example: Lattice

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3}

library(lattice)

xyplot( weight ~ Time, data = ChickWeight, type = "a")
```

Note the use of formula instead of "x =" and "y="

## Lesson: Tidyverse and Base R

Tidyverse is great, but ...

**Familiarity**

+ Tidyverse is one more damn thing to learn
+ What is the shop standard tool?

**Alternatives**

+ [Base R Packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages) and [Tasks](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)
+ [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) (Specialized Genomics - and [more](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EBImage.html))
+ [Microsoft R Open](https://mran.microsoft.com/open) (with built-in package management)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

## Slide with Bullets

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
