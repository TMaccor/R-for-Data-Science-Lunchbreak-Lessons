I've taught about 300 session on the R language 

for LinkedIn Learning 

(formerly Lynda.com)

## How are we alike? 
How are we different?

## Your Journey With R {.build}

A mandate to learn and use

You grumbled, but complied

A Branch:

- Those who didn't need it anymore (not here today)
- Those who did (This is you!)

You learned as much R as necessary

You also have domain and statistical expertise

## My Journey with R {.build}

An interest in programming languages

(That's it!)

No domain or statistical expertise

I've gone **really** deep on the language

## Our Priorities Differ {.build}
<div class="columns-2">

**You**

Interpret data

.

**Me**

Mess around with code

...and share it with you

</div>

## For Example...

## For Example: Matrix Math Review
<div class="columns-2">

```{r, echo=TRUE}

A + B

A - B

A * B # simple multiplication

A %*% B # Dot Product 

```
</div>

## Lesson: R is deep

There is a lot of R you may not know exists

There is a lot of R you will never use

There is a bit of R that will change your world and make you a rock star

## Lesson: Imposter Syndrome

## Lesson: Tidyverse and Base R

Tidyverse is great - but don't overlook base r

## Unpacking Knowledge 

## Five Minutes is All You Get

## Lack of Venue

## Research vs Education

## Q & A
