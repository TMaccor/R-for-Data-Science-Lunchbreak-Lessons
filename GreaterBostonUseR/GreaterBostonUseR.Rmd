I've taught about 300 sessions on the R language 

for LinkedIn Learning 

(formerly Lynda.com)

## For Example...

![](lil_rweek.png){ width=90% }

## For Example: Matrix Math Review
<div class="columns-2">

```{r, echo=TRUE}

A + B

A - B

A * B # simple multiplication

A %*% B # Dot Product 

```
</div>
*extra credit: what is A? what is B?

## Lesson: R is deep

There is a lot of R you may not know exists

*~ 1,500 functions in Base R*

There is a lot of R you will never use

There is a bit of R that will change your world and make you a rock star


## Example: Three Graphics Environments
**1. Base R**

plot, barplot, boxplot, cdplot, coplot, dotchart, fourfoldplot, 
heatmap, hist, matlines,matplot, mosaicplot, pie, spineplot, 
stemplot, stripchart, sunflowerplot

**2. ggplot**

Tidyverse package for grammar of graphics. VERY popular

**3. lattice**

+ included with R. Faster than ggplot, 
+ better awareness of output device. 
+ barchart, bwplot, densityplot, dotplot, histogram, qqmath, stripplot, qq, xyplot, levelplot, contourplot, cloud, wireframe, splom, parallel, rfs, tmd

## Example: Lattice

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3}

library(lattice)

xyplot( weight ~ Time, data = ChickWeight, type = "a")
```

Note the use of formula instead of "x =" and "y="

## Lesson: Tidyverse and Base R

Tidyverse is great, but ...

**Familiarity**

+ Tidyverse is one more thing to learn
+ What is the shop standard tool?
+ Tidyverse is not a universal standard.

**Alternatives**

+ [Base R Packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages) and [Tasks](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)
+ [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) (Specialized Genomics - and [more](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EBImage.html))
+ [Microsoft R Open](https://mran.microsoft.com/open) (with built-in package management)

## Lesson: Dates and Times Hurt

**There are three main Base R date structures**

- Date *(only stores dates)*
- POSIXct *(stores dates AND times as seconds)*
- POSIXlt *(stores dates AND times as list)*

**and two more...**

- chron
- difftime

... and yes, there is [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/)

## Example: Dates and Times

```{r, echo=TRUE}
HAL_online <- as.Date("1992-01-12")

as.numeric(HAL_online) # produces DAYS, not SECONDS
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
myPOSIXct <- as.POSIXct("March 14, 2015 at 9:26", format = "%B %d, %Y at %H:%M")

as.integer(myPOSIXct) # Seconds between midnight 1-Jan-1970 and 14-Mar-2015 at 9:26 am
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
myPOSIXlt <- as.POSIXlt("March 14, 2015 at 9:26", format = "%B %d, %Y at %H:%M")

myPOSIXlt[1, "year"] # POSIXlt is a list. Here is years since 1900
```


## Lesson: Imposter Syndrome
<div class="centered">
**Don't doubt your skills - You're not a fraud**
</div>

<div class="columns-2">

**You**

Domain and statistical expertise

A mandate to learn and use R

You grumbled, but complied

A Branch:

- Those who didn't need it anymore (not here today)
- Those who did (This is you!)

**Me**

No domain or statistical expertise

An interest in programming languages

I've gone **really** deep on the language

*Robert Heinlein said *

*"When one teaches, two learn"*

.

## Lesson: Unpacking Knowledge 

Data Science is **telling stories** and **visualizing numbers**


<div class="columns-2">
What is your point?

Why should anyone care?

Use less to tell more

Don't be impressed with everything you know

Bury the backstory

## Research vs Education
Teaching R is different than Using R

Using R (or any topic)

Do it in a way you best understand

Teaching R

Do it in the most straightforward manner


## Q & A

[This presentation on github](https://github.com/mnr/R-for-Data-Science-Lunchbreak-Lessons/tree/master/GreaterBostonUseR)

```{r}
qrcode_gen("https://www.linkedin.com/in/markniemannross/")
```

## A and B
```{r, echo=TRUE}
A <- matrix( c(1:9), nrow = 3)
A
B <- matrix( c(11:19), nrow = 3)
B

```
